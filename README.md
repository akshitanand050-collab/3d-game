# Dream Dealer

A surreal first-person exploration game where you play as a mysterious entity who enters people's dreams to extract fragments of their memories, emotions, and fantasies. Each dream world is procedurally generated with bizarre, symbolic architecture â€” floating cities, shifting gravity, and impossible landscapes.
