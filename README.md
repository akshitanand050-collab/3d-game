### **Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aaa-racing-championship.git
   cd aaa-racing-championship
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser or serve with a local server:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   # OR
   npx serve .
   ```

3. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser

## üèÅ Gameplay Guide

### **Starting a Race**
1. **Quick Race**: Jump straight into action with default settings
2. **Car Selection**: Choose your vehicle based on your driving style
3. **Track Selection**: Pick from various challenging circuits
